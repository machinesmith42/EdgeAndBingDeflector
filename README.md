# EdgeAndBingDeflector


*EdgeAndBingDeflector* is  a small helper application that intercepts URIs that force-open web links in Microsoft Edge and redirects it to the system’s default web browser, along with changing the search engine to Google or DuckDuckGo if necessary. This allows you to use Windows features like the Cortana assistant and built-in help links with the browser of your choice instead of being forced to use Microsoft Edge. With EdgeAndBingDefelctor, you’re free to use Firefox, Google Chrome, along with your favorite search engine!


You’ll never see EdgeAndBingDeflector ever again after installing it. It does its thing transparently in the background and only runs when a link needs to be deflected away from Microsoft Edge.

System requirements: Windows 10, and your favorite web browser.
